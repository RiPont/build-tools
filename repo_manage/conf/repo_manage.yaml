# Config for repo_manage

aptly:
  # Directory where aptly keeps its own repository
  root_dir: /buildteam/linux_repos/aptly
  gpg_key: 9BBE2052E9CB0900

createrepo:
  # createrepo operates on yum repositories in-place and has no repository
  # of its own, so there's no root_dir here; the yum repos will be formed
  # in the "rpms" subdirectory of the local/base_dir directory for each
  # target, defined below.
  gpg_key: 9BBE2052E9CB0900


# For the internal local repositories, base_dir should generally be
# /buildteam/linux_repos/${target}, but we allow specifying something
# different here just in case. This base dir will be extended with
# either "debian" or "rpms" to form the final root of the package
# archive.

# For S3, specify the region and bucket to populate, along with a prefix
# path. This prefix will also  be extended with either "debian" or
# "rpms" to form the base URL of the corresponding package archive. eg.,
# release apt repo is https://packages.couchbase.com/repos/debian/
