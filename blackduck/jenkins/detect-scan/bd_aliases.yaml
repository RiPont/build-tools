# The keys of this object are the *canonical* Black Duck component IDs.
# The values are objects with the following possible keys:
#
#  bd-id-aliases: an array of Black Duck component IDs for this same
#    component which have been used in manifests
#
#  fallback-versions: an object where both keys and values are single
#    versions for the component. The key is the version that we are
#    actually using. The value is a version known to exist in the
#    Black Duck Knowledgebase. update-manual-manifests will fall
#    back to the value version if the key version is not found when
#    attempting to add it to the project.
