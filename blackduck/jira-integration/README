Scripts here are used to create/update jira tickets from blackduck notifications

Jenkins job: http://server.jenkins.couchbase.com/job/jira-blackduck-integration
Target build agent: zz-lightweight
Jira Project: https://issues.couchbase.com/projects/VULN/summary
Jira bot account information is stored in lastpass

Setup:
    * Python 3.7+ is required
    * Run pip -r requirements.txt to install required python packages

    These files already exist on the build agent.
    * Create ~/.ssh/jira-creds.json, which contains login information for jira
        {
            "username":
            "apitoken":
            "url":
        }
    * Create ~/.ssh/blackduck-creds.json, which contains login infomation for blackduck
        {
            "username":
            "password":
            "url":
        }

Usage:
    python3 blackduck_to_jira.py -p ${project} -n "${previous_run}"

    i.e.
    python3 blackduck_to_jira.py -p couchbase-server -n "2022-05-09 20:05:01"
    python3 blackduck_to_jira.py -p couchbase-server

    * Currently, blackduck retains 30 days of notifications.  Without --newer (-n),
      the script will process all of them.  It is a good idea to not use "--newer"
      on the first run.  Subsequently, it is desired to pass in "--newer" option to
      skip the older notifications that were already processed.
